        <h2>Beau Facts</h2>

        <p>
            I adopted Beau from the animal shelter in Johnson City, Tennessee my senior year of High School while volunteering for my service learning dual enrollment class. 
            I had entirely no intention of adopting him, but the only day I brought my grilfriend to the shelter she insisted I ask my parents if I could adopt him. To my surprise
            my parents full heartedly supported it, and after meeting him and then again with our other dog he quickly became a member of the fam. I quickly became inseperable
            from my boy and he was the star of many hiking adventures. Beau is the reason I fell back in love with hiking and the outdoors and to this day his cuteness melts my heart.

       <h2>Breed: Appenzeller Sennenhund</h2>


       <p> 
            A medium-sized herding breed that is tri-color and almost squarely built and balanced. 
            He is muscular and agile and makes a good driving, watch, guard, house, or farm dog. Due to their versatility and willingness, they excel in agility, obedience, herding, and 
            search and rescue. The Appenzeller Sennenhund is one of the four Swiss Sennen type breeds and is also known as the Appenzeller Mountain Dog 
            or Appenzell Cattle Dog. He is lively, high-spirited, self-assured, reliable, and fearless. Slightly suspicious of strangers, he is a good watchdog who cannot be bribed. 
            The breed's intelligence make them highly capable learners. Due to his personality and exercise needs, he is ill-suited to apartment living.
