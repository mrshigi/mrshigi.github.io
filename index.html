                <p>
                    In CSCE 242, we get students to utilize HTML and CSS to design the front-end of a website;
                    matching a given specification. Secondly, they will use JavaScript to add
                    functionality to their website. Lastly, they will learn to utilize node and server side
                    JavaScript to store and retrieve data from a server. Specifically as a student in this class I hope to learn how to better format my own website and 
                    get skills that can translate to employability within a bank.
