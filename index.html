                        The goal of assignment 1 was to create a website of a classroom appropriate topic of one's
                        choosing, using no code from class. This included many basic HTML elements like headers, images,
                        and link.
                        I created my first webpage around my dog Beau and it was
                        glorious.

                        Assignment 2's objective was to create a new web page, on a topic of one's choosing This website
                        was to
                        include nav elements, a background, some CSS styling for all the text and pictures. I designed
                        around a Neon theme
                        and have stuck to these colors for many other assignments.

                        Assignment 3's goal was to create a single webpage which lays out content using css flexboxes
                        and I decided to continue my Neon/Evangelion theme. Prof. Plante taught to design mobile first
                        then larger resolutions with this assignment and it gave the basis of flexbox fundamentals.

                    and I decided to continue my Neon/Evangelion theme. This was basically a "make it look pretty"
                    assignment and it feels good to design something that looks and feels like me.
