                        The goal of assignment 1 was to create a website of a classroom appropriate topic of one's
                        choosing, using no code from class. This included many basic HTML elements like headers, images, and link.
                        I created my first webpage around my dog Beau and it was
                        glorious.

                    <p>
                        The objective of assignment 2 was to create a new web page, on a topic of one's choosing This website was to 
                        include nav elements, a background, some CSS styling for all the text and pictures. I designed around a Neon theme
                        and have stuck to these colors for many other assignments.

                    <p>
                        Assignment 3's goal was to create a single webpage which lays out content using css flexboxes
                        and I decided to continue my Neon/Evangelion theme. Prof. Plante taught to design mobile first
                        then larger resolutions with this assignment and it gave the basis of flexbox fundamentals.
