                        The goal of assignment 1 was to create a website of a classroom appropriate topic of one's
                        choosing, using no code from class. This included many basic HTML elements like headers, images,
                        and link.
                        I created my first webpage around my dog Beau and it was
                        glorious.

                        was to
                        include nav elements, a background, some CSS styling for all the text and pictures. I designed
                        around a Neon theme
                        and have stuck to these colors for many other assignments.

                        Assignment 3's goal was to create a single webpage which lays out content using css flexboxes
                        and I decided to continue my Neon/Evangelion theme. Prof. Plante taught to design mobile first
                        then larger resolutions with this assignment and it gave the basis of flexbox fundamentals.

                    assignment and it feels good to design something that looks good.

                    Elements can contain info via JavaScript and are animated via CSS, giving overall more function to
                    our websites.
                    This assingment also utilzes flex boxes to differentiate mobile and desktop.

                    Javascript.
                    This assingment had issues uploading and should now be fixed. This was practice to integrate loops
                    into assignment 7
                    and create a "running man" that looks a little goofy.
